This repo contains the projects I develop while learning Swift and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).

### English Premier League Explorer

Premier League Explorer is an iOS (SwiftUI) app that shows a list of English football clubs and lets you learn more about them. By selecting a team from the list, the team information is showed up, where user can find the foundation year of the club, the stadium, the club colors, and the list of players in this team. It uses [Football Data API](https://www.football-data.org/) for getting data about teams and competition.
